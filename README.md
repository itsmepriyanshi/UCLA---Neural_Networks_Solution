# Neural Network Training and Evaluation

This project involves training and evaluating a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier using the `sklearn` library. The goal is to classify data from the provided dataset and visualize the training process through a loss curve.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `train.py`: Main script for loading data, training the model, and evaluating performance.
- `evaluation.py`: Contains functions for evaluating the model and plotting the loss curve.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `logging`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib logging
